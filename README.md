# Welcome to my sample blog - it's not a very good blog. 

*Visit the live site* [Here](https://affectionate-lichterman-36ce02.netlify.com/) or 👉 https://affectionate-lichterman-36ce02.netlify.com/


The blog was build using *Hugo* and had been deployed on *Netlify*

Next aim is to implement it into a CMS to allow for user friendly content management 😁

After that I want to take an existing site and deploy it in the same way as the blog then tack the blog into the existing site and create my own custom hugo theme.
