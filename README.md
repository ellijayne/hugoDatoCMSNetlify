# Welcome to my sample blog - it's not a very good blog. 

*Visit the live site* [Here](https://affectionate-lichterman-36ce02.netlify.com/) or ðŸ‘‰ https://affectionate-lichterman-36ce02.netlify.com/

Theme used was [Hugo-theme-sam](https://github.com/victoriadotdev/hugo-theme-sam) from [victoriadotdev](https://github.com/victoriadotdev)


The blog was build using *Hugo* and has been deployed/hosted on *Netlify* and integrated with the *DatoCMS* for easy content management!

Now I want to take an existing site and deploy it in the same way as the blog then tack the blog into the existing site and create my own custom hugo theme.
